Quick Start with Heroku
---------------------------

The fastest way to get started with Elovation is to click the deploy to [Heroku](http://www.heroku.com) button below. Elovation can be run on the free tier, so all you will require is a Heroku account to get started with no running costs.

If you would like to add a level of authentication security to your app on Heroku, on the setup screen set the "BASIC_AUTH" to "true", and set a username and password in their respective fields. When you try to access your app in future, you will be prompted for your credentials.

You can set the branding on Elovation by defining the "ELOVATION_TITLE" variable in Heroku with your desired name.

The click to deploy button will automatically migrate your database.
